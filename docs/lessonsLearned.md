# Lessons Learned

## JavaScript Module Exports

During our development, we encountered issues with duplicate exports in our JavaScript modules. Here are the key lessons learned:

1. **Be consistent with export patterns**: Choose either individual exports (`export function name()`) or a consolidated export block at the end of the file. Mixing both can cause runtime errors.

2. **Consolidate exports when possible**: For modules with multiple functions, using a single export block at the end of the file makes it easier to:
   - See all exported functions in one place
   - Add or remove exports without modifying function declarations
   - Maintain cleaner code organization

3. **Check for consistency across files**: When adding new functions or modules, ensure they follow the same export pattern as the rest of the codebase.

## Responsive Design

Implementing responsive design requires careful planning and testing. Key takeaways include:

1. **CSS Grid for responsive layouts**: Using `grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(320px, 1fr))` creates a flexible grid that adapts to different screen sizes.

2. **Media queries for fine-tuning**: Add specific breakpoints to optimize layouts for different device sizes:
   - Desktop (1200px+): 4 columns
   - Large tablets (992px-1199px): 3 columns
   - Small tablets (768px-991px): 2 columns
   - Mobile (<767px): 1 column

3. **Flexible containers**: Implement flex layouts with `space-between` and `flex-wrap: wrap` to create adaptable UI elements.

4. **Test on multiple devices**: Always test responsive designs across various screen sizes to ensure a good user experience.

## UI Component Organization

1. **Component-based structure**: Breaking UI elements into reusable components improves maintainability.

2. **Centralized state management**: Using an AppState object allows for consistent data flow throughout the application.

3. **Event delegation**: Implementing proper event handling improves performance and code organization.

4. **Toggle functionality**: Implementing view toggles requires careful coordination between:
   - UI event handlers
   - State management
   - DOM updates
   - CSS styling
