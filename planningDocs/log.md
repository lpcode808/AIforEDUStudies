## Project Implementation Log

### 2025-02-24 12:21:09 HST - Initial Setup and Approach

After reviewing the plan, I've determined the following approach for the first phase of implementation:

**Implementation Strategy: "Foundation First"**

I'm choosing to start with a minimal but functional foundation that we can build upon. This approach will:
1. Get something working quickly to validate core concepts
2. Allow for rapid iteration and feedback
3. Ensure we have a solid base before adding complexity

**Phase 1 Implementation Plan:**
1. Create basic directory structure (index.html, data folder, js folder)
2. Create a simple data/studies.csv with 5 sample entries
3. Implement minimal HTML/CSS for the initial UI
4. Integrate Fuse.js for basic search functionality
5. Test locally using a simple development server

**Local Testing Approach:**
- Use `live-server` as suggested in the plan for local development
- This requires minimal setup (just an npm install) and automatically refreshes the browser

**Next Steps:**
1. Create index.html with basic structure
2. Create the data directory with sample studies.csv
3. Create basic JavaScript for loading and searching the data
4. Test locally with live-server
5. Document the structure for future reference

**GitHub Pages Deployment (to be implemented after local testing):**
- Will follow the GitHub Actions workflow in the plan for automatic CSV to JSON conversion
- Setup .github/workflows/sync.yml for continuous deployment

This foundation-first approach provides quick wins while setting us up for the more complex features outlined in the plan.

### 2025-02-24 12:26:12 HST - Phase 1 Implementation Complete

I've completed the implementation of Phase 1 of the GenAI Education Research Explorer. Here's what was accomplished:

**Project Structure**
- Created the basic directory structure (index.html, css/, js/, data/)
- Set up package.json with dev dependencies and npm scripts
- Created a GitHub workflow file for deployment

**Data Layer**
- Created data/studies.csv with 5 sample studies spanning different research domains
- Implemented a CSV parser (js/csv-parser.js) that handles quoted fields and special formatting

**Presentation Layer**
- Created a clean, responsive UI with index.html and css/styles.css
- Implemented study cards that display key information in an organized layout
- Added support for filtering UI with category pills

**Interaction Layer**
- Integrated Fuse.js for fuzzy search across all study data
- Implemented category filtering with toggle functionality
- Added date range filtering for temporal analysis

**Local Development**
- Set up live-server for local testing
- Created npm start script for easy development server startup

**Documentation**
- Created comprehensive README.md explaining the project structure and functionality
- Added comments throughout the code for maintainability

**GitHub Pages Deployment**
- Created .github/workflows/sync.yml for automatic deployment
- Set up CSV to JSON conversion as part of the workflow

**Next Steps for Phase 2:**
1. Test and refine the search functionality
2. Enhance the filtering system with more metadata options
3. Add visualizations for study distributions
4. Implement sorting options for search results
5. Add unit tests for core functionality
6. Optimize for performance with larger datasets

The foundation is now in place with a working MVP that demonstrates the core functionality. This implementation follows the CSV-driven approach specified in the plan, with all the essential components for searching and filtering research studies.

### 2025-02-24 12:26:59 HST - Added External Links Support

I've enhanced the application to support direct links to the original studies, which will allow users to easily access the source materials. These enhancements include:

**Data Structure Updates**
- Added a `url` field to the CSV structure to store links to the original studies
- Updated sample data with placeholder URLs that follow a consistent pattern

**UI Enhancements**
- Modified the study cards to display titles as clickable links when a URL is present
- Added styling for links with hover effects to improve usability
- Ensured links open in a new tab with appropriate security attributes

**Documentation Updates**
- Updated README.md to reflect the addition of the URL field
- Documented the new data structure and link functionality

This enhancement allows us to connect our explorer directly to the source materials, making it more valuable for researchers and educators. To properly implement this feature with real data, we would need to:

1. Extract actual URLs from the source website (https://www.aiforeducation.io/ai-resources/studies-related-to-generative-ai-in-education)
2. Map those URLs to the corresponding studies in our database
3. Update our CSV file with the real links

For security and usability, we've implemented the links with `target="_blank"` and `rel="noopener noreferrer"` attributes to prevent potential security issues when opening external links.

**Next Steps:**
- Consider implementing a web scraper to automatically extract URLs from the source website
- Add validation to ensure URLs are properly formatted
- Explore adding additional metadata about the linked resources (e.g., PDF vs. web page)

### 2025-02-24 12:35:35 HST - URL Scraping Scripts Added

I've added web scraping scripts to extract study URLs from the AI for Education website. These scripts will help populate our database with links to the original studies, enhancing the value of our research explorer.

**Script Implementations**
- Created both Node.js and Python implementations for flexibility
- Implemented robust error handling and detailed logging
- Added string similarity matching to associate scraped URLs with our existing studies

**Node.js Implementation**
- Uses Axios for HTTP requests and Cheerio for HTML parsing
- Includes a package.json with all necessary dependencies
- Provides an npm script for easy execution

**Python Implementation**
- Uses Requests for HTTP requests and BeautifulSoup for HTML parsing
- Includes a requirements.txt file for dependency management
- Supports both relative and absolute URLs with proper conversion

**Additional Documentation**
- Created a README.md in the scripts directory with detailed usage instructions
- Added explanations of how the scripts work and their limitations
- Provided a manual alternative process for small datasets

**Integration with Existing System**
- Scripts generate a new CSV file with URLs added to preserve the original data
- Output is saved as data/studies-with-links.csv for easy review
- Implementation maintains compatibility with our existing CSV structure

These scripts provide a starting point for URL extraction, but the actual selectors will likely need to be adjusted based on the specific HTML structure of the website. The current implementation uses a generic approach that looks for common patterns in study listings.

**Future Improvements:**
- Add command-line arguments for customization (e.g., input/output file paths)
- Implement more sophisticated text matching algorithms
- Add support for batch processing multiple websites
- Create a web interface for manual URL verification and correction

### 2025-02-24 12:38:06 HST - Local HTML Parsing Scripts Added

I've enhanced our URL extraction strategy by creating scripts that parse a local HTML file of the website instead of scraping the live site. This approach is more reliable and avoids potential issues with network connectivity, rate limiting, or changes to the website.

**Local HTML Parsing Scripts**
- Created both Python and Node.js implementations for flexibility
- Designed to work with a downloaded copy of the AI for Education webpage
- Implemented multi-pass extraction to maximize the number of links found

**Advanced Extraction Techniques**
- First pass: Extract study links by navigating the document structure (h4 headers followed by content)
- Second pass: Look for paragraphs with bold text and links that might contain studies
- Smart title matching that handles minor variations in wording

**Enhanced String Similarity**
- Node.js version: Improved word-based similarity algorithm that counts matching words
- Python version: Uses Python's SequenceMatcher for accurate string comparison
- Detailed logging of similarity scores to help identify potential matches

**Documentation and Usage**
- Updated the scripts README.md with clear instructions for both approaches
- Added explanations of how the local HTML parsing works
- Provided guidance on when to use each approach

**Benefits of Local HTML Parsing**
- More reliable than web scraping (no network issues, no rate limiting)
- Faster execution since all parsing is done locally
- Can be run offline once the HTML file is downloaded
- Preserves the exact state of the website at the time of downloading

This enhancement completes our toolkit for extracting URLs from the AI for Education website. Users can now choose between web scraping (for convenience) or local HTML parsing (for reliability) based on their needs and circumstances.

**Next Steps:**
- Run the local HTML parsing scripts on the downloaded file
- Verify the extracted URLs and update the studies.csv file
- Consider creating a merged script that combines extracted links from multiple sources for maximum coverage
